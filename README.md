# DataAnalysis_Nickel-Exploration

## A data analysis from nickel exploration

## Introduction
Nickel has been a rising comodity in Indonesia due to it's value and prospect for the increasing demand of superconductor and resistant alloy. One of resource where Nickel (Ni) can be explored and exploited is the Lateritic Nickel Ore Deposit.

To estimate the value of Ni contained in the prospect area, an exploration is carried. Drilling will produce subsurface data needed for it. The results were dataset below.
