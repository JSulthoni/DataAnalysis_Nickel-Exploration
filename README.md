# Data Analysis for Nickel Exploration


## Introduction
Nickel has been a rising comodity due to it's value and prospect for the increasing demand of superconductor and resistant alloy material. 

This was a project data I tried to redo by using Python. The results were the dataset below.



## The Dataset
[THE DATASET](https://github.com/JSulthoni/DataAnalysis_Nickel-Exploration/tree/41eedd816903bfa66af79d4dfefc1085c81a0673)

Note: 
- The BHID and coordinate in this dataset has been altered to protect the original owner.
- 4 tables have their relation to each other through BHID.


## Step 0. Importing The Data
Importing Excel database into python by using pandas.

## Step 1. A Simple Data Analysis
The company asked a simple data anaysis to review the reconciliation.

## Step 2. An Deeper Look Is Needed
By sorting the Ni value, it was found that DHP075 have an outstanding sample.

## A Case Study
The company wanted to know if there are outliers and what to do with them.
